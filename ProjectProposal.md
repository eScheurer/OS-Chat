# Project Proposal

Project name:
Chat Room

## Description
Multi-Client to a Multi-threaded Web Server. We want to creat a multithreaded webserver hosting a multi client chat.
* The communication works via internet so the server and clients don't have to be in the same network.
* The functionalities should be accessible via a website for everyone who visits the website.
* The server should be able to host multiple chats at a time, clients can join and exit the chat of their choice.
* A chat can be protected via a password so that everyone can see that the chat exists but only the ones who know the password can join.
* A client can only be in one chat at a time (though they can open multiple tabs at a time).
* All current chats are displayed on the website for clients to join. Clients should be able to create their own chatrooms.
* Each client runs on its own thread.
* Chats exist as
* The server should host up to ... clients?
* The clients threads are already pre-existing and are assigned to a client and recycled.
